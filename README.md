# Spam SMS Detection

## Overview
This project aims to detect spam messages using machine learning techniques. Identifying spam messages is essential to ensure a cleaner and safer communication environment.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to develop and deploy a machine learning model that accurately classifies SMS messages as spam or legitimate.

## Key Components
- **Data Collection:** Describe the source and nature of the data used for training the model.
- **Data Preprocessing:** Detail how data was cleaned, transformed, and prepared for modeling, including tokenization and vectorization techniques like TF-IDF.
- **Feature Engineering:** Explain any feature selection or creation methods used.
- **Model Selection:** Discuss the machine learning algorithms considered and chosen for the task, such as Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or Support Vector Machines.
- **Model Training:** Outline how models were trained and evaluated using appropriate metrics.
- **Deployment:** If applicable, explain how the model was deployed for real-time predictions.
- **Usage:** Provide instructions on how to use the spam detection model.

## Directory Structure
- **/data:** Contains datasets used for training and testing.
- **/notebooks:** Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation.
- **/scripts:** Python scripts for data preprocessing, model training, and deployment.
